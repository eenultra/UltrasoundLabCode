The 7 suffix means they are to be used with Robwin7 and have the icons of Robwin7
Robwin7 works with Windows 7, Vista and XP

If you are using a much older version of Windows e.g. 98 or 95 then use RobWin 68.
Then refer to documents of the same name but with 6 suffix e.g.
					primer6.pdf
					tutorial6.pdf
RobWin65 is a special version with RobWin68 icons but with a separate communications "console".
Otherwise stick to RobWin7.
